/**
MysteryGroup Component

A component that displays a group of Mysteries from the Rosary, such as Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious, or Luminous mysteries.

Responsibilities:
- Receive a "title" (string) and "items" (array) through props.
- Render a heading for the mystery group.
- Display each mystery as a list item.

Notes:
- This component is intentionally generic so it can be reused four times inside the main Mysteries component.
- Future responsive styling will be added through CSS Modules.
