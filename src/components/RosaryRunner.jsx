/**
* RosaryRunner.jsx
*
* This
is the component responsible for managing the progress
* of the Rosary prayer sequence. It receives the selected set of mysteries
* and the list of fixed steps, and provides controls to move forward or backward.
* This component does not decide which mystery set is used; it only handles
* the user's current position within the sequence and triggers callbacks
