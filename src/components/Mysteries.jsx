/**
Mysteries Component
This component renders all four groups of Rosary mysteries:
Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious, and Luminous. Each group is displayed using the reusable <MysteryGroup /> component.

Responsibilities:
- Load all mystery titles and lists from i18n.
- Pass the correct translated content to each MysteryGroup instance.
- Display the main section title for the Mysteries view.

Notes:
- This acts as a container/grouping component.
- The structure is built for clarity, scalability, and accessibility.
