/**
Prayer Component
This component displays a single prayer from the Rosary.
It requires a "title" (string) and "text" (string) passed as props.

Responsibilities:
- Render the prayer title with proper semantic tags.
- Render the full prayer text, supporting multi-line content.
- Serve as a reusable building block for the prayer list.

Notes:
- Useful for rendering prayers individually or inside a collection.
- Styling will later ensure readability and accessibility.
